# Book Tracker - Project 1 of 9: The Java Compound Portfolio

## Project Overview
**Book Tracker** is the first foundational project in the **"Java Compound"** portfolio series. This project introduces the basics of Java programming, focusing on core syntax, control structures, and user interaction through the console. By building this project, learners will gain the essential skills needed to tackle progressively advanced projects, culminating in the **Library Management System**.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Core Java**: Basic syntax, loops, and conditionals.
- **Console Input/Output**: Using the `Scanner` class for user interaction.
- **Data Structure**: Simple array for storing book titles.

---

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand and apply basic Java syntax.
2. Use loops and conditionals to process data effectively.
3. Handle console-based input and output using the `Scanner` class.
4. Manage and store data using arrays.

---

## Features
- Add books to the tracker.
- Display the list of stored book titles.
- Exit the program when finished.

---

## Project Structure
1. **Input Handling**: Use the `Scanner` class for user input.
2. **Loops**: Continuously prompt the user for actions (e.g., add a book, display books, exit).
3. **Arrays**: Store book titles in an array for retrieval.

---

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the program in a Java-supported IDE or terminal.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to:
   - Add new book titles.
   - Display the current list of books.
   - Exit the program when complete.

## Part of the "Java Compound" Portfolio
This project is the first in a series of nine, each building on the skills and functionality learned in the previous one. The roadmap is as follows:

### **Technology Roadmap**

1. **Book Tracker**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java (basic syntax, loops, and conditionals), console input/output, arrays.
   - **Goal**: Learn basic Java programming, loops, and handling user input/output.

2. **Book Manager**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (ArrayList).
   - **Goal**: Introduce dynamic data structures using `ArrayList` for book management (adding, displaying, and removing).

3. **Member Tracker**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (ArrayList), basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
   - **Goal**: Manage members using classes and objects, adding OOP principles like encapsulation.

4. **Enhanced Book Manager**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (ArrayList), intermediate OOP.
   - **Goal**: Expand OOP by associating additional properties (author, genre) with books and managing them as objects.

5. **Library System Base**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (ArrayList), intermediate OOP, menu-driven console programming.
   - **Goal**: Combine books and members into a unified system with an interactive console-based menu.

6. **Transaction Tracker**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (ArrayList), advanced OOP.
   - **Goal**: Introduce transactions by associating members with book borrowing and returning functionality, reinforcing OOP principles.

7. **Persistent Library System**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (ArrayList), file handling (reading/writing to `.txt` files).
   - **Goal**: Add persistence to the system by saving and loading books and members from files.

8. **Advanced Library System**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (HashMap, ArrayList).
   - **Goal**: Use advanced data structures like `HashMap` for efficient book and member management.

9. **Interactive Library System**
   - **Technologies**: Core Java, Collections Framework (HashMap, ArrayList), sorting and searching algorithms.
   - **Goal**: Enhance the system's usability by adding search, sort, and filter functionalities with an interactive console.

---

## Conclusion
By completing **Book Tracker**, you'll establish a solid foundation in Java, preparing you to handle more complex data management tasks in subsequent projects. Each project builds on the last, progressively adding new features and technologies until the final **Library Management System** is complete.
